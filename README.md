# Link Prediction Data Challenge

As part of the INF554 - Machine and Deep Learning at Ecole Polytechnique, we had to compete in a in-class Data Challenge with over 150 competitors. The Data Challenge focused on the link prediction using graph information and textual information for each node. It required graph analysis techniques such as Word2Vec and NLP. 

For this challenge, we built a team of 3 people including Roxane Fischer and Paul Jacob.
